                <h2>My Journey</h2>
                <p>I've been swimming ever since I was about 3 years old. I learned how to swim on my own with my family, and ever since that, I've been swimming in all kinds of places!</p>

                <h2>Techniques</h2>
                <p>I'm the best at 'frog' swimming, and I've found that I can swim faster than many people who swim 'professionally' :D</p>

                <h2>Favorite Spots</h2>
                <p>My favorite spots are all in Turkiye, since that's where I swim every summer.</p>
